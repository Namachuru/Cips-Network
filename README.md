# Cips-Network

Cips is an idea I had for 19 years now. it means City Interactive Precincts. It is suposed to be a network that provides important services to clients. So far it is under reconstruction and there is a Library service, Computer Classroom, Used Car Dealership, there will be an online games service and a farming information service.

Each service is like a website in its own respect
